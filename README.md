## 📖 Overview

This project presents a **lightweight cryptographic algorithm** tailored for **cloud computing environments**, designed to provide high security with minimal computational overhead.  
The system employs a **128-bit Feistel–Substitution–Permutation (FSP) cipher** architecture inspired by Shannon’s **confusion** and **diffusion** principles.

The algorithm supports **configurable key sizes (up to 256 bits)** and a **variable number of encryption rounds**, offering a balance between performance and cryptographic strength.
